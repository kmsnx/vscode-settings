# VS Code Settings

These are my VS Code settings optimized mostly for Web development, but they are flexible enought to meet almost every developer needs.

It's perfect setup for anyone who needs to quickly improve his/her coding expirience in VS Code, without reading VS Code docs about preferences and etc. 
Enjoy!

### Install
- Settings: Just copy everything from my settings.json file and paste it to your 'settings.json' in VS Code.
- Extensions: `./extensions.sh`
